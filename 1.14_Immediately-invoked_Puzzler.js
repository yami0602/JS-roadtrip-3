// Now the Pine Puzzle-makers have sent you a puzzle with a new set of
// functions to use on that puzzle. To display your overwhelming array and
// function expression mastery, alert the answer to the following question:
//
//    “What is obtained when the result of passing 9 into the fourth function
//    of the puzzlers array is then passed into the function whose array index
//    matches the result of passing 3 into the second function of the puzzlers
//    array?”
//
// To really impress them, the expression used in your alert should:
//
//  - Use just one line of code.
//  - Involve no manual calculation or hard-coded math on your part.
//  - Use indices of arrays to access functions.
//  - Use parentheses to pass in parameters to immediately-invoking functions.
