// Video 5.6 accompanies this exercise

// Now that we’ve got a Fencepost constructor function, let’s creates some
// posts! The cowboy-devs need three new posts for the Pastures:

x: -3,
y: 4,
postNum: 18

x: 5,
y: -1,
postNum: 19

x: -2,
y: 10,
postNum: 20

// Use your Fencepost constructor function to create these new posts. Name
// each of your posts post<number> with the correct number from the postNum property.
//
// Then, connect them with the sendRopeTo function using the following
// criteria, and remember that one connection requires ropes to be sent from
// both posts:
//
//  1. If two posts both have even-numbered y coordinates, they should be connected.
//  2. If two posts both have odd-numbered x coordinates, they should be connected.
