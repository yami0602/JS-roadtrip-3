// The developers at the Closures Cave sometimes need to provide warnings to
// travelers about various obstacles that sometimes float into the Cave. They
// need you to prepare a very efficient warning maker that will allow them to
// create only the warnings they need, and only when they need it. Closures
// to the rescue!
//
// Theyâ€™ve started a function called warningMaker with a parameter called
// obstacle. Within this function, return an anonymous function that displays
// a specific alert message based on the specific obstacle encountered. The
// format of the message should be as follows:
//
//      Beware! There have been <obstacle> sightings in the Cave today!
//
// Note: You do not need to call the warningMaker function.
