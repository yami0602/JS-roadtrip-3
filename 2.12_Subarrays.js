// Well, itâ€™s nice for new travelers to know where the danger zones are, but
// what if some of them are thrill-seekers? They might actually want to visit
// the zones that have the highest number of obstacles.
//
// We already have a list of danger zones, and now the Dev Girls at the Cove
// want you to add a number alongside each of the locations.
//  1. Using the zones array, push a sub-array containing both the location and
//     number for each obstacle.
//  2. Inside the for loop, find a way to access those values from the zones
//     array in order to add them to the list string.
//  3. The final alert should be displayed in the following format:
//
//      Beware! There have been <obstacle> sightings in the Cove today!
//      <number> have been spotted at the <location>!
//      This is alert #<count> today for <obstacle> danger.
//      Current danger zones are:
//      <zone1> (<number1>)
//      <zone2> (<number2>)
//      <zone3> (<number3>)
//      ...
//
// Use the code below in your solution:

function warningMaker(obstacle) {
  var count = 0;
  var zones = [];
  return function(number, location) {
    count++;
    var list = "";
    // push an array with location and number
    zones.push([number, location]);
    for (var i = 0; i < zones.length; i++) {
      // replace location and number with appropriate code
      list += zones[i][1] + " (" + zones[i][0] + ")" + "\n";
    }
    console.log("Beware! There have been " + obstacle +
          " sightings in the Cove today!\n" +
          number + " have been spotted at the " +
          location + "!\n" +
          "This is alert #" + count +
          " today for " + obstacle + " danger.\n" +
          "Current danger zones are:\n" +
          list);
  };
}
