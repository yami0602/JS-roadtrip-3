// The pirates are really rough today! Add a new ranger to the lighthousePointe
// object by calling your addRanger method with the following information:

name: "Jordan Wade"
skillz: "dual-wield hand crossbow"
station: 4

// Use the following code in your solution:

var superBlinders = [ ["Firestorm", 4000], ["Solar Death Ray", 6000], ["Supernova", 12000] ];

var lighthousePointe = {
  gateClosed: true,
  weaponBulbs: superBlinders,
  capacity: 30,
  secretPassageTo: "Underwater Outpost",
  numRangers: 3,
  ranger1: {name: "Nick Walsh", skillz: "magnification burn", station: 2},
  ranger2: {name: "Drew Barontini", skillz: "uppercut launch", station: 3},
  ranger3: {name: "Christine Wong", skillz: "bomb defusing", station: 1},
  addRanger: function (name, skillz, station){
    this.numRangers++;
    this["ranger" + this.numRangers] = {
      name: name,
      skillz: skillz,
      station: station
    };
  }
};

// call the addRanger method on lighthousePointe
