// To let mother cows rest, the cowboy-devs at the Prototypes Pastures have
// decided only to breed cows that have not given birth to any calves yet.
//
// Now they want to add some functionality to the Object prototype itself.
// They’ve asked you to build two functions, in order:
//
//  1. First, build a function called noCalvesYet, which will be added to the
//     Object prototype.
//  2. If the object type is a "cow" and also had no calves, the function
//     should return a true value. Otherwise it should return a false value.
//  3. Then, build a function called countForBreeding, which will be added to
//     the Array prototype.
//  4. In countForBreeding start by creating a numToBreed counter variable.
//     The following steps refer to code in countForBreeding.
//  5. Use a for loop to loop through all of the array values. You can use
//     this to refer to the current list.
//  6. Call noCalvesYet(). If it returns true for the current array value,
//     then that means the cows are not moms, and we can increment the
//     numToBreed counter variable.
//  7. After your loop, this function should return the numToBreed count,
//     which represents how many non-mother cows are available within any array.
//
// Here is a list of cattle for your reference:

var forestCows = [
  {name: "Legolas", type: "calf", hadCalf: null},
  {name: "Gimli", type: "bull", hadCalf: null},
  {name: "Arwen", type: "cow", hadCalf: null},
  {name: "Galadriel", type: "cow", hadCalf: null},
  {name: "Eowyn", type: "cow", hadCalf: "Legolas"}
];
