// The developers at the Ocean of Objects need help creating data structures
// for the three different ranger vehicles they use to battle pirates on the
// Ocean.
//
// Here are the vehicles listed in order of type, passenger capacity, and
// storedAt location.
//
//  1. Motorboat, 6, Ammunition Depot
//  2. Jet Ski, 1, Reef Dock
//  3. Submarine, 8, Underwater Outpost
//
// In the order listed, build three object literals with the names vehicle1,
// vehicle2, and vehicle3.
//
// Within each object literal, create properties for type, capacity, and
// storedAt, and use the same order provided above. Make sure to store numbers
// as number values, and text as string values.


var vehicle1 = {
    type: 'Motorboat',
    capacity: 6,
    storeAt: 'Ammunition Depot'
}

var vehicle2 = {
    type: 'Jet Ski',
    capacity: 1,
    storeAt: 'Reef Dock'
}

var vehicle3 = {
    type: 'Submarine',
    capacity: 8,
    storeAt: 'Underwater Outpost'
}
