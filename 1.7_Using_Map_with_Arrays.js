// Video 1.6 accompanies this exercise

// Over at Magnolia Mountain, the dev team has received some name data from
// the customer terminal that they want to use to customize greetings for each
// of their passengers. But the data consists of an array with many subarrays
// where the first and last names of each passenger are split up.
//
// They want to take the passengers array below and convert those subarrays into
// strings that contain the first and last name for each passenger.
//
//  - Create a modifiedNames variable to store our new data.
//  - Assign passengers.map() to the modifiedNames variable. This will allow
//    us to pass in a function to be used on every element in the array.
//  - Pass an anonymous function to map().
//  - The anonymous function should take in arrayCell as a parameter and use
//    that to return a string with the first and last name for a passenger.
//    In other words, if you were to pass in a ["Jason", "Millhouse"] array,
//    the function should return a "Jason Millhouse" string.
//
// Use the code below in your solution. Then log modifiedNames to the console.

var passengers = [ ["Thomas", "Meeks"],
                   ["Gregg", "Pollack"],
                   ["Christine", "Wong"],
                   ["Dan", "McGaw"] ];
const modifiedNames = passengers.map((arrayCell) => {
     return arrayCell[0] + ' ' + arrayCell[1];
});

console.log(modifiedNames.join('\n'));
